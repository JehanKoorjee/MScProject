# MScProject

This repository contains 3 files: schedule.js, mulitpack.js and package.js (which allows mulitpack to run using the command "npm run multipack"). schedule.js and mulitpack.js have been referred to in the thesis. Instructions on how to use them are in the "Project_ Twilio for Experience Sampling" resource located on this repository. 

NOTE: If the instructions on the Project_ Twilio for Experience Sampling resource are not followed, the scripts will not run.
